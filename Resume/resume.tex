\section{Projects}
\runsubsection{chainifyDB}
\descript{Transform DB into Blockchain System}
\location{Jan 2019 – Present | Published at CIDR'2021 | Project Leader}
Designed and developed the distributed architecture of \href{www.chainifydb.com}{chainifyDB} that allows customers to transform their existing database infrastructure into a permissioned 
blockchain system. chainifyDB ensures zero down-time, end-to-end encryption, and as low as 17\% performance overhead on the underlying database system.

\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Fabric++}
\descript{Optimizing Permissioned-Blockchain Systems}
\location{Jan 2018 – Oct 2018 | Published at SIGMOD'2019}
Integrated MVCC and TransactionReordering into Hyperledger Fabric, improving the transaction throughput by up to 12x for contended workloads.
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{AnKerDB}
\descript{Hybrid OLTP/OLAP Processing}
\location{Apr 2016 – Dec 2017 | Published at PVLDB'2016 and SIGMOD'2018}
Integrated a new system-call inside Linux-kernel to create snapshots of virtual memory. Designed and developed a prototype main-memory, column-store database system that exploits the snapshot system call, to execute analytical workloads under serializable isolation-level at the cost of read-uncommitted isolation level in MVCC.
